# nullptr
It represents a null pointer constant. It provides a type-safe way to represent a pointer that points to nothing, replacing the older NULL macro, which is typically defined as 0 or (void*)0.

### Key Features of nullptr:
Type Safety: Unlike NULL, which can be ambiguous (it can be interpreted as an integer), nullptr is of type std::nullptr_t. This means it can be implicitly converted to any pointer type but not to an integer type, reducing potential errors.
Clear Semantics: Using nullptr makes it clear to readers of your code that you're dealing with pointers. This can improve code readability and maintainability.
Overload Resolution: When using function overloading, nullptr can help disambiguate function calls that might otherwise be confused with integer values.

### Type Safety
``` cpp
int* p = nullptr; // p is a null pointer of type int*

int n = nullptr; // Error: cannot convert ‘std::nullptr_t’ to ‘int’

```
### Overload Resolution
When function overloading is involved, nullptr helps clarify which function is being called. This is particularly useful when there are overloads that accept pointers and those that accept integers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void func(int) {
    std::cout << "Called func(int)\n";
}

void func(char*) {
    std::cout << "Called func(char*)\n";
}

int main() {
    func(0);         // Calls func(int)
    func(nullptr);   // Calls func(char*)
    return 0;
}
```
### Comparison
```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;

if (ptr == nullptr) {
    std::cout << "ptr is null\n";
}
```
### Use with Smart Pointers
nullptr is also commonly used with smart pointers, such as std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr. It can be used to initialize them as null:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<int> uptr(nullptr); // Initialize with nullptr
```
### Avoiding Ambiguity in Templates
```cpp
template <typename T>
void process(T* ptr) {
    if (ptr == nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Received a null pointer\n";
    }
}
int main() {
    process(nullptr); // Correctly deduces T as int
    return 0;
}
```
### Use in Class Constructors
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    
    MyClass() : data(nullptr) {} // Initialize pointer to null
};
```
###  Limitations
1. While nullptr improves safety, be aware that it cannot be used in contexts where an integer is expected. 
   This behavior prevents unintended mistakes but requires careful handling in some scenarios.
2. nullptr cannot be used in a context where void* is expected without an explicit cast.

# rvalue references
It allows developers to differentiate between lvalues and rvalues. They enable a powerful optimization technique known as move semantics, which can significantly improve performance, particularly for resource management in objects.

### Key Concepts
Lvalues vs. Rvalues:

Lvalues: Objects that have a persistent address in memory. They can be identified by their names (e.g., variables).
Rvalues: Temporary objects that do not have a persistent address. They typically arise from expressions like literals or the results of operations.
Rvalue Reference Syntax: An rvalue reference is declared using &&:

```cpp
int&& rvalue_ref = 5;  // rvalue reference to a temporary
```

### Benefits of Rvalue References
Performance: They reduce unnecessary copies of objects, especially for temporary objects, improving performance in many cases.
Resource Management: They provide a clear and efficient way to transfer ownership of resources (e.g., memory) without the overhead of copying.

# trailing return type
In C++, a trailing return type is a syntax that allows you to specify the return type of a function after its parameter list, using the auto keyword and the -> syntax. This feature was introduced in C++11 and can be particularly useful in several scenarios, such as:

Complex Return Types: When the return type depends on the types of the parameters.
Lambda Expressions: In conjunction with auto when defining generic functions.
Template Functions: To keep function declarations clean.

### Syntax

``` cpp
auto functionName(parameters) -> returnType {
    // function body
}

```
### Example

``` cpp
auto add(int a, int b) -> int {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Sum: " << add(5, 3) << std::endl; // Outputs: Sum: 8
    return 0;
}
```
### template
``` cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T, typename U>
auto multiply(T t, U u) -> decltype(t * u) {
    return t * u; // Return type is deduced based on t * u
}

int main() {
    auto result = multiply(3, 4.5); // result is of type double
    std::cout << "Product: " << result << std::endl; // Outputs: Product: 13.5
    return 0;
}
```
### lambda
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto lambda = [](int a, int b) -> int {
        return a + b;
    };
    
    std::cout << "Lambda Sum: " << lambda(10, 20) << std::endl; // Outputs: Lambda Sum: 30
    return 0;
}
```

### Benefits
Readability: It can make the function signature cleaner and improve readability, especially when the return type is complex or depends on the parameters.
Flexibility: It provides greater flexibility for generic programming, allowing return types to be defined based on the parameters.
Convenience: Especially useful in templates and when using decltype, reducing the need for boilerplate code.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# decltype
decltype is a keyword used to query the type of an expression at compile time. This can be particularly useful in generic programming and when working with complex types, allowing you to determine types without needing to explicitly specify them.

### Basic Syntax

```cpp
decltype(expression) variableName;

int a = 10;
decltype(a) b = 20;  // b is of type int

int x = 5;
decltype(x) y = 10;       // y is int (lvalue)
decltype((x)) z = x;      // z is int& (lvalue reference)

decltype(x + 1) w = 2.5;  // w is double (rvalue)
```

decltype(x) gives int.
decltype((x)) gives int& because the expression (x) is an lvalue.
decltype(x + 1) gives double since the expression x + 1 is an rvalue.

###  Function Return Types

```cpp
double multiply(double a, double b) {
    return a * b;
}

decltype(multiply(2.0, 3.0)) result; // result is of type double
```
### Templates

```cpp
template <typename T, typename U>
auto add(T t, U u) -> decltype(t + u) {
    return t + u; // Return type is deduced based on t + u
}
```
### Benefits
It allows for type deduction and preserves the value category of expressions. 
It enhances the flexibility and type safety of your code, especially in generic programming scenarios.
By using decltype, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code without sacrificing type information.

## Uniform Initialization in C++

In C++, a uniform initializer is part of the uniform initialization feature introduced in C++11. It allows you to initialize objects using braces `{}`. This syntax can help prevent certain types of errors, such as narrowing conversions.

## Basic Syntax
You can initialize basic types like integers and floats using uniform initialization:

```cpp
int x{5};      // Initializes x to 5
float y{3.14}; // Initializes y to 3.14
int arr[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes an array with 5 elements

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
Point p{10, 20}; // Initializes a Point object with x=10 and y=20
```

## Conclusion
Uniform initialization in C++ is a powerful feature that simplifies initialization and enhances type safety. It’s widely used in modern C++ programming.

# constexpr

The `constexpr` specifier in C++ is used to indicate that a function or variable can be evaluated at compile time. This allows for optimizations and can enable certain programming patterns that require compile-time evaluation.

### Example Usage

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

constexpr int result = square(5); // result is evaluated at compile time
```
### Limitation
1. C++11 introduced constexpr but had limitations. Only simple functions could be marked as constexpr, and the body of such functions was restricted.
2. Not all types can be used with constexpr. For example, types without constexpr constructors (like certain standard library types) can’t be used.
3. Some operations, like dynamic memory allocation or exceptions, cannot be performed within constexpr functions.

### Practical Benefits
1. Using constexpr can lead to more efficient code by enabling compile-time calculations, reducing runtime overhead, and allowing the compiler to optimize code more aggressively.
2. It enhances performance and expressiveness, especially when used appropriately with compile-time constants and functions.

# auto
The auto keyword is used for type inference, allowing the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable at compile time. This can simplify code and make it more readable. Here’s a detailed explanation of how auto works:

### Basic Usage
``` cpp
auto x = 42;          // x is deduced to be int
auto y = 3.14;       // y is deduced to be double
auto z = "Hello";    // z is deduced to be const char*

vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
auto it = vec.begin(); // it is deduced to be std::vector<int>::iterator

auto add(int a, int b) -> int {
    return a + b;
}

auto lambda = [](int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // The return type is automatically deduced
};

std::cout << lambda(5, 3); // Outputs: 8
```

### Limitations
1. You must initialize the variable at the point of declaration; otherwise, the compiler cannot deduce the type.
2. In cases with ambiguous initializers, such as function pointers or overloaded functions, type deduction can lead to compilation errors.
3. It enhances code clarity and maintainability by reducing redundancy and simplifying type declarations. Its appropriate use can lead to cleaner and more         
   efficient code.

# final
The final specifier is used to indicate that a class cannot be inherited from or that a virtual function cannot be overridden in derived classes. 
This helps enforce certain design choices and can improve performance by allowing the compiler to make optimizations.

### Preventing Inheritance
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { 
        std::cout << "Base class show function." << std::endl; 
    }
};

class Derived final : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        std::cout << "Derived class show function." << std::endl;
    }
};

// This will cause a compile-time error
// class FurtherDerived : public Derived { };

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.show();  // Outputs: Derived class show function.
    return 0;
}
```

### Preventing Function Overriding
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() {
        std::cout << "Base display function." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override final {  // No further overrides allowed
        std::cout << "Derived display function." << std::endl;
    }
};

// This will cause a compile-time error
// class FurtherDerived : public Derived {
// public:
//     void display() override { }  // Error: cannot override final function
// };

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.display();  // Outputs: Derived display function.
    return 0;
}
```

### Benefits of Using final
Preventing Inheritance: When applied to a class, final prevents any other class from deriving from it.
Preventing Function Overriding: When applied to a virtual function, final prevents any derived class from overriding that function.
